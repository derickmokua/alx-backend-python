# 🌀 Python Generators Project – Efficient Data Processing with Yield

## 📚 About the Project

This project explores advanced usage of **Python generators** to efficiently handle large datasets, process data in batches, and simulate real-world scenarios involving live updates and memory-efficient computations.

The tasks are designed to leverage Python’s `yield` keyword to implement generators that provide iterative access to data. This promotes **optimal resource utilization** and enhances **performance in data-driven applications**.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

✅ **Master Python Generators**  
Learn to create and utilize generators for iterative data processing, enabling memory-efficient operations.

✅ **Handle Large Datasets**  
Implement **batch processing** and **lazy loading** to work with extensive datasets without overloading memory.

✅ **Simulate Real-world Scenarios**  
Develop generator-based solutions to simulate live data updates and apply them to streaming contexts.

✅ **Optimize Performance**  
Use generators to calculate aggregate functions (e.g., averages) on large datasets while minimizing memory consumption.

✅ **Apply SQL Knowledge**  
Use SQL queries to fetch data dynamically, integrating Python with **MySQL** or **SQLite** for robust data management.
