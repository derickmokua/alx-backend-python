Python Generators
This project explores advanced use of Python generators to handle large datasets efficiently using the yield keyword. It includes setting up a MySQL database, seeding it with CSV data, and creating generators to process data lazily and simulate real-time updates.
🔍 Key Concepts Covered:

    Generator functions with yield

    Lazy loading & batch processing

    Streaming and live data simulation

    Performance optimization for large datasets

    SQL integration (MySQL) for dynamic data fetching

🛠️ Tools Used:

    Python 3.x

    MySQL

    CSV
